    I feel confident enough with the content on arrays that I believe I could code using the information presented about arrays without referencing the source material. 
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    There is not! I was thorough enough to have a grasp of what I'm responsible for understanding in this lesson.

    I don't have any additional questions about arrays...yet.
