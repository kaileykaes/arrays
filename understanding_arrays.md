# Check for Understanding

## Create a new project (aka directory) and initialize a Git repository in it. Make 1 file - arrays.rb, and make an initial commit. In that file:

- Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Strings.
- Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Integers.
- Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Floats.
- Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Booleans.
- Commit your work.
- Call 1 of each of the 4 methods you learned, on each of the 4 arrays you   created above. On the line of code above that, write (in a Ruby comment) an explanation in plain English as to what impact calling that method will have on that specific array.
- Commit your work.
- **Intentionally open-ended** Demonstrate your understanding of index positions in this file. You can write an explanation, provide some examples with the Arrays you’ve created, or anything else.
- Commit your work.
- Use the Ruby Documentation to learn about one additional Array method of your choice. Provide an explanation and example to demonstrate your understanding of it. (Consider bookmarking the official Array docs!)
- Commit your work.
- Create another file in the same directory, name it self-evaluation.md. In Markdown, answer the following questions:

    1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

- Commit your work.
- After you’ve completed the tasks above, push your work up to a new GitHub repository. Provide the GitHub repository link in the submission form.
